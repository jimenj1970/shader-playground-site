The GUI application works on top of the RGA command line tool, which supports a rich set of APIs including Vulkan™, DirectX11® and OpenGL®.

This documentation will focus on the GUI application, which currently supports:

- Vulkan™ live-driver mode
- OpenCL™ for Rocm, on top AMD's LLVM-based Lightning compiler
