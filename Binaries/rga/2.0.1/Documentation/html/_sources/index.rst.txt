The Radeon GPU Analyzer 
=======================
The Radeon GPU Analyzer (RGA) GUI application is an offline compiler and a code analysis tool for OpenCL™ on top of AMD's LLVM-based Lightning Compiler.

The GUI application works on top of the RGA command line tool, which supports a rich set of APIs including Vulkan™, DirectX11® and OpenGL®.

This documentation will focus on the GUI application. More information about the RGA command line tool can be found in its help manual ("-h" option), or on the `RGA Github page <https://github.com/GPUOpen-Tools/RGA>`_.
